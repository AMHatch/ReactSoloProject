# Nicks Boots React Site 

***[link to deployed site](https://amhatchreactsite.netlify.app/)***


Nicks Boots is a handmade boot manufacturer in Spokane, Wa. 
I am a fan of their product so i decided to remake a portion of their website, which has annoyed me in the past. 
Im using this project to familiarize myself with React, Redux and Material UI .
