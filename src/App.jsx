                        <div>
                            For the last two years, we've been working tirelessly with our USA tanneries to produce leather that is more similar to the "classic boot leather recipe" we used decades ago. The 1964 Brown is similar to these older leathers in temper and color. While our current work boot leathers are great and have worked well for years, we are always looking to improve. We have packed oils, waxes, and natural conditioners into the leather so that they'll feel even better out of the box. They are just as durable as our current offerings and work great in all applications, including fire. After field-testing the leather, it wears and burnishes like every boot should, gaining character as it takes a beating.
